## What is the Fact Graph?

The Fact Graph is a production-ready knowledge graph for modeling, among other things, the United States Internal Revenue Code and related tax law.
It can be used in JavaScript as well as any JVM language (Java, Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, etc.).

## Onboarding and Set Up
See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) for environment/developer setup.

See [the Fact Graph 3.1 ADR](docs/fact-graph-3.1-adr.md) for more information about the fact graph and how it has been changed since early 2025
See [here](docs/from-3.0-to-3.1.md) for a brief description of changes between the older versions of the Fact Graph and the current v3.1 in this repository 

## Fact Graph API (local demo)

docker compose up --build
```

### Verify health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health

## Useful documentation
* [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/) - the testing framework we use
* [scala-xml](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.19/scala-xml/scala/xml/) - the standard implementation of XML (don't be put off by the sparse-seeming API docs, the function definitions have very good examples)
